# Electricity Usage Exploratory Data Analysis

## Energy Consumption Analysis  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes electricity usage data. The notebook performs data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to identify trends and patterns in electricity consumption.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this analysis is **Energy Consumption Data.csv**, containing time‐stamped records of electricity usage.

## Analysis Steps  
The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - Import necessary libraries  
   - Load the dataset  
   - Handle missing values and correct data types  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Calculate descriptive statistics (`.describe()`, `.info()`)  
   - Visualize distributions and relationships (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)  

3. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Resample data for yearly, quarterly, monthly, and daily trends  
   - Decompose seasonal and trend components  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Generate line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, distribution plots, and box plots to highlight key patterns  

## Tools Used  
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Findings  
- **Temperature vs. Consumption**  
  No strong or consistent correlation between average temperature and energy consumption, suggesting either highly efficient building insulation/cooling systems or that additional variables (e.g., occupancy, equipment load) are needed to reveal clearer patterns.

- **Weekday vs. Weekend Usage**  
  Energy consumption is markedly lower on weekends and peaks during mid‐week days, reflecting reduced commercial and industrial activity on weekends and consistent business, office, and residential usage during the week.

- **Daily Demand Cycle**  
  A pronounced diurnal pattern: consumption rises during daytime hours (work and household routines) and declines overnight when most people are asleep and businesses are closed.

- **Overall Distribution**  
  Hourly usage follows an approximately normal distribution with a slight right skew—most values cluster at moderate levels, while the long right tail captures occasional high‐consumption days (e.g., seasonal peaks or special events).

- **Variability by Day Type**  
  Weekdays exhibit both a higher median consumption and greater variability compared to weekends, underscoring the impact of the standard workweek on electricity demand.

## Usage  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electricity-usage-eda.git
   ```  
2. **Navigate to the project directory**  
   ```bash
   cd electricity-usage-eda
   ```  
3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Electricity_Usage_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb
   ```  
5. **Run the notebook cells** to execute the full analysis.
