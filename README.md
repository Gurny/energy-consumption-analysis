# Energy Consumption Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes energy consumption data. The notebook performs data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to identify trends and patterns in energy usage.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is "Energy Consumption Data.csv", containing information about energy consumption over time.

## Analysis Steps

The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Imports necessary libraries, loads the dataset, and handles missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Calculates descriptive statistics, visualizes data distributions, and explores relationships between variables.
3. **Time Series Analysis:** Resamples the data to analyze trends on different time scales (yearly, quarterly, weekly, daily).
4. **Visualization:** Creates visualizations to present the findings, including box plots, histograms, and line charts.

## Tools Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciPy

## Findings
